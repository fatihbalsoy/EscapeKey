EscapeKey is a very simple macOS menu bar application that lets you simulate the `esc` key. This is useful if your MacBook's TouchBar is frozen, blank, and causing other inconveniences. Like every other Apple Device.

If you need a full on-screen TouchBar, then you might find [Touché](https://redsweater.com/touche/) useful. However, it does not display the `esc` key on some MacBooks.

A better alternative to EscapeKey is to remap the MacBook's escape key to `caps lock` in the System Settings. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/05/15/escape-key-shortcut-tutorial/#:~:text=On%20macOS%2C%20you%20must%20go,like%20Escape%2C%20then%20click%20OK.). Unfortunately, this will disable the `caps lock` key's default behavior.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of the application with the `.dmg` file extension [here](https://github.com/fatihbalsoy/EscapeKey/releases/). To install, open the `.dmg` file and drag EscapeKey into your Applications folder. To launch the app for the first time, right-click it and click `Open`.

## Usage

On first use, the application will ask for accessibility persmissions to simulate the escape key. You can allow and disallow this permission at any time in your System Settings. 

Once you open the app, a window will pop-up. You may close it. The escape key icon will show up in your menubar. Clicking it will simulate an escape key. Right-clicking the icon will display a non-functioning alternative button for cases where you'll need to press it with the command `⌘` key. This will be available on the next release.

You may also setup the app to always launch on every login by adding EscapeKey into your Login Items in System Settings.
